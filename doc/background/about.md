# About Taggloo

Taggloo (in Manx Gaelic: _talking_) is a project that emerged from my own requirement to have an online source of Manx Gaelic words whilst learning and developing my skill-set.

## Version History

Taggloo has moved through various versions:

v0 was very much a prototype to test the idea, which gained enough traction to warrant a fully built ...
v1 provided a complete web-based dictionary including phrase lookups based on searching for text.
v2 added an API and modified the layout to be suitable for mobile devices, it also optimised interaction with social media, in particular Twitter and YouTube.
v3 was not released and is an aborted version, though moves towards various techniques in v4 were involved.
v4 provides everything from v2, but builds on the concept of phrase translation and removes integration with Twitter.
