# Taggloo4

Taggloo is a Manx Gaelic to English translation tool, designed to fill a hole in the internet for users requiring Manx Gaelic translation services.

## Version 4

Taggloo has moved through various versions:

**v0** was very much a prototype to test the idea, which gained enough traction to warrant a fully built ...
**v1** provided a complete web-based dictionary including phrase lookups based on searching for text.
**v2** added an API and modified the layout to be suitable for mobile devices, it also optimised interaction with social media, in particular Twitter and YouTube.
**v3** was not released and is an aborted version, though moves towards various techniques in v4 were involved.
**v4** provides everything from v2, but builds on the concept of phrase translation and removes integration with Twitter.
